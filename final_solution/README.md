We made a empty env using miniconda. run 'conda create --name myenv python' to make a new empty enviroment in miniconda
1)Open/cd to the folder 'final_product'. run python install -r requirements.txt.
2) Put the 'gg_2015' and 'gg_2013' data inside of final_solution. run python gg_api.py
3) Our solutions runs both 2013 and 2015 at once. So after finishing compiling. The json outputs will be in answer_2013.json and answer_2013.json. The human-readable output will be printed in the terminal.
4) There's a function called winner_presenter_nominees_helper that is run to return all three outputs. Please run that function instead of the three separate functions.
