# CS337-Project-1

Minimum Requirements:

Fulfilling only the minimum requirements puts your group on track for a B

A project must do a reasonable job identifying each of these components.

Host(s) (for the entire ceremony)
Award Names
Presenters, mapped to awards*
Nominees, mapped to awards*
Winners, mapped to awards*
*These will default to using a hardcoded list of the awards to avoid penalizing you for cascading error. Please note that, when mining award names specifically, you cannot hardcode parts of these names in your solution.

It is OK not to have 100% accuracy. It's very rare for any group not to have some error, especially with nominees. Even getting just half of the nominees for a given award is quite good performance.

Additional Goals:

To get better than a B, you must do exceptionally well on the minimum requirements, or complete one or more additional goals. Some examples of additional goals:

Red carpet – For example, determine who was best dressed, worst dressed, most discussed, most controversial, or perhaps find pictures of the best and worst dressed, etc.
Humor – For example, what were the best jokes of the night, and who said them?
Parties – For example, what parties were people talking about the most? Were people saying good things, or bad things?
Sentiment – What were the most common sentiments used with respect to the winners, hosts, presenters, acts, and/or nominees?
Acts – What were the acts, when did they happen, and/or what did people have to say about them?
Your choice – If you have a cool idea, suggest it to the TA! Ideas that will require the application of NLP and semantic information are more likely to be approved.
Typical performance on the minimum requirements, plus a well-done additional goal, is likely to earn an A- or better.
